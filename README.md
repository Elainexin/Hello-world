# Hello-world
Pick up my coding skills and get back into the market.

I am going to move to Toronto very soon. I don't have any friends or acquaintances there. I've never been to Canada in my life. It's a scary new world out there, especially for someone who's gonna go there alone. I am a little bit freaked out yet super excited about exploring this new adventure.
